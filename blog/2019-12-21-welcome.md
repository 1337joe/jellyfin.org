description: Static pages built with Hugo, and more communication.

Welcome to our brand new website.

At first glance, it may not look like much has changed - the theme and colours are still the same, and so is our frontpage. What has changed, is what's under the hood. Our website is now built using [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io), a static-page generator written in Go.

As part of the move, we've decided to introduce this new blog, where you'll be able to hear more about Jellyfin's new releases, future development, and goals. Occasionally, we'll feature guest posts from some of our own contributors.

Thank you for using Jellyfin. We can't wait to share what's next!
