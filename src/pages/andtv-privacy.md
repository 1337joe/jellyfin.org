# Jellyin for Android TV - Privacy Policy

Jellyfin does not purposefully gather any information about your usage of the app or media playback.

On devices with supported hardware, you may be prompted to enable microphone access, to allow voice search. This is strictly optional, and is not required to use the app. Any audio processing happens at the device provider level, and is never sent to Jellyfin.
