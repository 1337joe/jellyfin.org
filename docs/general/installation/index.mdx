The Jellyfin project and its contributors offer a number of pre-built binary packages to assist in getting Jellyfin up and running quickly on multiple systems.

:::caution
[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) and its derivatives, such as [TrueNAS CORE](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-core/), are **NOT** supported by Jellyfin and the .NET framework it uses.

Even though there are builds available online for these platforms, they are unofficial and from [a separate project](https://github.com/Thefrank/jellyfin-server-freebsd). If you do encounter issues on these platforms, please ask for support in their respective support channels FIRST.

[TrueNAS SCALE](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/) is based on Linux and therefore is officially supported. Please install the Jellyfin app from its app repository.
