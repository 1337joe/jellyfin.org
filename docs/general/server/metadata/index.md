# Metadata

Jellyfin can get metadata for your media through multiple sources. By default, Jellyfin ships with the following providers:

- The Movie Database (TMDb)
- Open Media Database (OMDb)[^1]
- [Local .nfo files](nfo)

[^1]: OMDb only provides English metadata.

There are more official providers available in our [Plugin Catalog](/docs/general/server/plugins#official-plugins), like TheTVDB, Fanart.tv or aniDB. If you still can't find the provider you are looking for, you could even develop your own with our Plugin API.
